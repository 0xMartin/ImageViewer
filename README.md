# Image Viewer
The application allows you to view pictures on the watch. This application is designed for Fitbit Versa 3. The user uploads the images in the settings of this application and then can view them on the watch. A maximum of 20 images can be uploaded. 
## Instructions for uploading and deleting an image
You can add new images in the settings of this application on your mobile in the Fitbit application. After adding an image to the settings, it will be automatically uploaded to the watch. Sometimes a connection error may occur and the image will not move to the watch (then you must click the "Reqest sync" button and synchronize the watch data with the mobile data). It can synchronize all images (button at the top) or specifically an image (button below the image). The image can be deleted with the "Delete all" button.
